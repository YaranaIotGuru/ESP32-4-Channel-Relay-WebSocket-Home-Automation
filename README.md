# ESP32 4-Channel Relay WebSocket Home Automation

Welcome to the ESP32 4-Channel Relay WebSocket Home Automation project by Yarana IoT Guru!

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a home automation system using the ESP32 microcontroller to control a 4-channel relay module. By integrating WebSocket communication, you can remotely manage your home appliances in real-time via a web interface.

## Features

- Control up to four electrical devices independently.
- Real-time status monitoring of each relay.
- Seamless integration with web browsers for remote control.
- Easy setup and customization for your smart home needs.

## Requirements

- ESP32 microcontroller board
- 4-channel relay module
- Wi-Fi network
- Web browser (for remote control)

## Installation

1. Upload the code to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE or platform of your choice.
2. Connect the relay module to the ESP32 according to the provided pinout diagram.
3. Power on your ESP32 and connect to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer or smartphone.
4. Open a web browser and enter the IP address of your ESP32 to access the web interface.

## Usage

1. Toggle the relay buttons on the web interface to control your connected appliances.
2. Monitor the real-time status of each relay to stay informed about your devices' state.
3. Customize and expand the system according to your smart home requirements.
